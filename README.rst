===================================================================
 Extensions to `OpenERP` kernel for all dependant XOPGI components
===================================================================

`XOPGI` include all general Merchise 'OpenERP'' addons.

The name *XOPGI* comes from *Progiciel Libre de Gestion Intégré*, in french
"Free Software for Integrated Management". The word "Libre" is changed for
"Open". The term is similar to `OpenERP` in french.

This module never will be installed manually, it will be used automatically
for all XOPGI's dependant components.
