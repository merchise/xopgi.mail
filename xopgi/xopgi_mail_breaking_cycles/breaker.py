#
# This pair of Router & Transport avoid the mail-sending cycles when two
# or more parties in a single thread have auto-responders:
#
# 1- Party A sends a message
# 2- Odoo resends to Party B
# 3- The party B's auto-responders send the automatic message to Odoo
# 4- Odoo resends to Party A
# 5- The Party A's auto-responders send the automatic message to Odoo.
#
# This, of course, assumes that both Party A and B have buggy auto-responders
# that auto-respond to messages which are themselves auto-submitted.
#
# The VERP Transport already bails out when the message being sent is an
# auto-submitted one.  So this addon plays well with VERP.
#
# What we do is that when sending auto-submitted messages we replace the
# Return-Path, Reply-To, Sender and From with a 'breaking-cycle' address, if a
# auto-submitted message is received for any 'breaking-cycle' address is
# simply ignored.
#


# The default alias for breaking cycle address.  You may configure the
# parameter 'mail.breaking-cycle.alias'.
