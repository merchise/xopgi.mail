    This is needed by the transport to properly build a bounce address which
    include the id of the mail_mail object and since a single mail_mail is
    create for each recipient of the message, any of which can bounce.

    Transports are only provided with the `message`, but we need to know which
    recipient is bouncing.  That's why we serialize the sending in a way that
    `send_email` is called with the "mail_id" in the `context`, which is then
    inspected by our transport.
