'''Rogue bounces.

Rogue bounces are bounces sent to the wrong address.  We *know* they are
bounces via specific probes.  Rogue bounces detectors should only work if they
can find the original thread from which the message was sent.

Most of the time it won't be easy to know the author of message that bounced,
but at least we can place a proper notice for all internal users and remove
the bouncing address.

Probes are basically MailRouter with a different interface.  When any probe
tells us the message is a rogue bounce, we stop checking other probes.

See the interface in `IRogueBounceProber`:class:.
