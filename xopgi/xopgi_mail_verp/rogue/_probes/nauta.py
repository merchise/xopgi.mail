    '''Test if this a rogue from nauta.cu.

    Tests:

    - The Return-Path is a "void" return path.

    - The Content-Type is 'multipart/report; report-type=delivery-status;...'

    - The message contains a 'message/delivery-status' part with
      Reporting-MTA: dns; smtp.nauta.cu

    If there's a message/rfc822 part will see if there's a
    'X-Odoo-Thread-Index' to get the thread's index.  We require that such
    message contains a header whose value is a bounce address.  Such bounce
    address will be used as the 'possible return path'.

    If no possible return path is found this probe will return None.
