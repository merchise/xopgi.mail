    '''Test if this is a rogue bounce from ahabana.co.cu.

    This probe is designed for bounces coming from ahabana.co.cu that don't
    follow RFC descriptions for automatic responses.

    No standard bounces patterns are found on this messages. So, only three
    tests are used:

    Tests:

    - The Reply-To contains noreply@ahabana.co.cu.
        Assuming that automatic responses usually use a 'noreply' address as
        reply-to path because there is no interest of receiving an answer.
    - The X-Actual-From contains MDaemon
        Assuming that this particular field is used for automatic responses
        sent by Mailer Daemon.
    - Subject contains notification of no delivery.
        This may change but this is a rogue bounce after all.
